# HIKE IT BLE ESPHome Component

Full-featured BLE integration for HIKE IT throttle controllers, may also work for other branded throttle controllers.

## Features

- Auto-connect on boot with automatic reconnection
- Speed model control (10 modes: Economy, Normal, Cruise, Sport, Hike IT, Auto, Launch, Anti-Slip, Valet, SL)
- Step adjustment for each speed mode
- Lock/Unlock with PIN
- Screen on/off toggle button
- Status sensor with connection state
- Automation triggers (on_connected, on_disconnected, on_verified, message)

## Installation

### 2. Get Your Device MAC Address
Use the Python script first to scan for your device MAC address:
```bash
python test\hikeit_ble.py
# Choose option 2 to scan for HIKE IT devices
# Note down the MAC address
```

### 3. Configure ESPHome
Use the example YAML below, replacing the MAC address with yours.

Configure secrets for hikeit_mac_address and hikeit_pin

```yaml
esphome:
  name: hikeit
  friendly_name: Hikeit
  
esp32:
  board: lolin_s3
  framework:
    type: esp-idf

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

1. **Device not connecting:**
   - Verify MAC address is correct
   - Check ESP32 logs: `esphome logs hikeit_bike.yaml`
   - Ensure device is in range (<10m)
   - Try power cycling both ESP32 and HIKE IT device

2. **Verification fails:**
   - Check logs for "Verification FAILED!"
   - Device might need button press for pairing
   - Try disconnecting from phone app first

3. **Reconnection loop:**
   - Device ID not captured - check logs
   - BLE interference - move away from WiFi router

### Command Issues

1. **Commands not working:**
   - Ensure device is verified (check status sensor)
   - Check logs for "No cached state" warnings
   - Wait for Type 02 message before sending commands

2. **Lock/Unlock fails:**
   - Verify PIN in YAML matches device PIN
   - Check logs for "Wrong PIN" status
